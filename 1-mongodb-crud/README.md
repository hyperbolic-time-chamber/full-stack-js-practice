# MongoDB CRUD

You will implement the database layer of an already running Express app. Specifically, you will implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This time you will be using MongoDB only (using the mongoose npm module).

## Getting Started

Navigate to mongodb-crud in terminal
Run 'npm install' in the mongodb-crud folder
Run 'npm start' to start the server

## Your Task

All of your work will be in the following files:

- `server/controller.js`

You are to implement the CRUD methods in the controller. You can run your tests to ensure your methods are working correctly. Instructions below for running tests.

There is no front-end for this app. Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to debug it.

As an added challenge, consider refactoring your solution to make use of ES6 arrow functions and const / let variable declarations.
