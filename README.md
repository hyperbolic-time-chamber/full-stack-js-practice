# Full Stack JS Practice

This repo contains a series of exercises designed to help you practice building pieces of an app or program using JavaScript and/or Node.js.

Breakdown of the exercises is as follows.

## 1 - MongoDB CRUD

You will implement the database layer of an already running Express app. Specifically, you will implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). You will be using Mongo + Mongoose.

## 2 - MySQL CRUD

You will implement the database layer of an already running Express app. Specifically, you will implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This time you will be using MySQL only (using the mysql npm module). You may refactor to use Sequelize if you wish but only after implementing CRUD using just MySQL.

## 3 - Callbacks and Promises

You will complete a series of problems using callbacks. You will then promisify these callbacks using the native Promise API and complete the same exercises using promises.

## 4 - React API Fetcher

You are to create a React app. You will fetch data from a public API, render, and implement some interactive features e.g. clicking on a picture will...do someting...and you should also be able to filter the data.

## 5 - AngularJS API Fetcher

You are to create an AngularJS app. You will fetch data from a public API, render, and implement some interactive features e.g. clicking on a picture will...do someting...and you should also be able to filter the data.

## 6 - Express Routing

You will implement routing in an express server. Each route yields a different resource. All resources are stored in text files. You may need to make use of the file system to read these files and retrieve the data for the appropriate route.
