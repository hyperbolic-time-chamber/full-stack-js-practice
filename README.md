# Full Stack JS Practice

This repo contains a series of exercises designed to help you practice building pieces of an app or program using JavaScript and/or Node.js.

Breakdown of the exercises is as follows.

## 1 - MongoDB CRUD

You will implement the database layer of an already running Express app. Specifically, you will implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). You will be using Mongo + Mongoose.

## 2 - MySQL CRUD

You will implement the database layer of an already running Express app. Specifically, you will implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This time you will be using MySQL only (using the mysql npm module). You may refactor to use Sequelize if you wish but only after implementing CRUD using just MySQL.

## 3 - Promise Me

You will complete a series of problems using callbacks. You will then promisify these callbacks using the native Promise API and complete the same exercises using promises.
