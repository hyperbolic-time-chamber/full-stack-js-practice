!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!
DO NOT install any promise-based libraries such as bluebird.js.

To get the most out of these exercises, try your best at completing callback functions so you know how they work.  Then convert them into promises without using any additional dependencies.  Hint:  There's a native Promise object available to you.
!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!

STEPS:
1) complete callbackReview.js
2) complete promiseReview.js
3) review the tests and see how they are invoked (you'll notice it's much cooler than callback hell).
4) review the solutions for examples
